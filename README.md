<h1 align="center">Summary</h1>

The summary of my work and life journey is a testament to my diverse experiences and adaptability. I began my professional life as a Credit Manager at Rent-A-Center, where I honed my financial and customer service skills. Later, I transitioned to Vivint, where I worked as a Field Service Technician, gaining valuable hands-on experience in the field of home security and technology after a work related injury I was repositioned to Customer Loyalty where I learned the back end of the company and further expanded my customer relation skills and knowledge of sales force. 

However, life took a different turn when my child was diagnosed with autism, prompting a shift in priorities. As a dedicated parent, I made the decision to become a full-time caregiver and advocate for my child's needs. This shows my unwavering commitment to family.

In my pursuit of personal and professional growth, I chose to expand my skill set by enrolling in an Information Technology course through Course Careers. This decision demonstrates my determination to build a new career path that accommodates my current circumstances while ensuring my own growth and development.

My journey is a reflection of resilience and adaptability, balancing career pursuits with the profound responsibilities of parenthood, and demonstrates my continuous commitment to personal and professional growth.

Throughout my career, I've held managerial roles in several of my previous positions. Specifically, I've managed teams at McDonald's and Rent-A-Center, and I've also served as a Field Service Technician and Customer Loyalty Representative at Vivint. Over the years, I've consistently built upon my knowledge and skill sets, adapting them to various industries. Currently, I am eager to further broaden my horizons and venture into the field of Information Technology.
